# MTC Proof Ideas

This folder documents promising proof strategies, partial progress,
and unfinished approaches for the sorry'd theorems in the MTC module.

Files are named by the source file they relate to, e.g.
`Pivotal.md` contains ideas for proofs in `Pivotal.lean`.

See `../TODO.md` for the full list of open sorrys.
